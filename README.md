# Tic_Tac_Toe
Please read README first.

There are Two modes Attached
Two Player Mode was made first followed by Single Player Mode
Just press any Grid to start the game.

Neither of the Modes can detect the winner as there was a lack of time to include this.
In Single Player Mode 'X' is made by the user and 'O' is made by the computer. The placement of 'O' is random and thus the computer is beatable.
